## Skateboard

- Made a skateboard in onshape which consists of 4 parts. 
- These four parts are the deck, truck baseplate, truck hanger, and a bushing.  
- The skateboard overall was easy, understanding the instructions was no problem.

### Evidence
[Here's a link to my onshape document](https://cvilleschools.onshape.com/documents/1c044ab2223ab01faa77a423/w/95af1057bb73e3adaa0124b6/e/3a89690b4044e1bea6dd5535?renderMode=0&uiState=6178043421cf1e297d05853c)


### 2.1 The Deck

- The purpose of the deck was to learn how to extrude and fillet a rectangle with curves.
- The deck consists of a rectangle with two big circles on the end.
- These shapes turned into a skateboard.

### 2.2 The Trucks

- The goal of this truck baseplate was to attach the wheels to the deck. 
- The trucks consist of three parts, the baseplate, hanger, and bushing.
- The baseplate is a plate for the base of the truck.
- The hanger helps attach the wheels to the baseplate.
- The bushing connects these two pieces together.

### 2.3 Wheel and Bearings

- The wheels were made to attach to the trucks.
- The sketch was simply two rectangles on top of each other.
- Using the tool revolve helped turn a simple sketch into a wheel

### 2.4 Putting it all together

- The assembly was pretty easy, using the fastened mate tool made it fairly easy. 
- The purpose of the fastened mate tool was to lock something in place. 
- Which made sure nothing moved when assembled.

### Reflection

- This assignment was pretty easy except some steps which were confusing. 
- There were things i've never used before, like offset and use. 
- These different tools made onshape much easier.
